Run the code and enter desired value of n.
The simulation will start for grid size 2 cross 2 to
n cross n .

Press Space Bar to pause the simulation

Press r key on keyboard to restart simulation on current grid size,
with new starting and destination vertex .

After simulation has ended that is drunker has reached its
destination , press escape key to shift to the next simulation .
If all the attempts are completed , escape key will close the 
simulation window , hence indicating the programme ran successfuly
and is completed .
