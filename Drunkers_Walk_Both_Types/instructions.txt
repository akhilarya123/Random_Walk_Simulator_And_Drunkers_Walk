Run the code and enter desired value of n.
The simulation will start for grid size 2 cross 2 to
n cross n .

Press Space Bar to pause the simulation

First for a grid size of i cross i (2 =< i <= n) , simulation will run 
following self avoiding rule , and when it gets completed the simulation
will run for the same grid (with same size and starting , ending points ) .

Press r key on keyboard to restart simulation on current grid size,
with new starting and destination vertex .(This only works if the current simulation is
the one following self avoiding rule , that is the prior one ).



After simulation has ended that is drunker has reached its
destination , press escape key to shift to the next simulation .
If all the attempts are completed , escape key will close the 
simulation window , hence indicating the programme ran successfuly
and is completed .
