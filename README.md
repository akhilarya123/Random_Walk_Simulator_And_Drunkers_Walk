# Random_Walk_Simulator_And_Markov_Chain
In this project I have simulated random walk on a 2 dimensional grid using networkx and opencv library in python . The results are also studied including that concerning Markov chain .

Run the programme to start the simple random walk on a 2 dimensional graph
To end the simulation just press escape key .
